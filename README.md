# GUI library for Allegro 5

###### TO DO:
  - ~~replace booleans with bitflags~~ *partially done*
  - ~~make Label more universal (fewer constructors, heavy bitflags use), maybe rename it to TextBox~~ *done*
  - add option to make ScrollableArea(ScbA) zoomable
  - normal text selection *right now only CTRA+A and CTRL+C, CTRL+V are supported, and only in InputField*
  - code cleanup, variables name correcting, variable and struct usage optimization 
  - (?) adding new widgets to ScbA via template
  - (?) (examples) have you heard about dynamic_cast ? :D
